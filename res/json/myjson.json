O God! God!\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\nFie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\nBut two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.\nSo excellent a king, that was to this\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him</p>"
